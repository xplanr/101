# CONTRIBUTING

There is a magic variable `the` passed around to functions that need
special preferences. This variable is initialized in `src/about.py` where
it can be (optionally) updated from the command line. Best practice
is to grep the defaults, do a deepcopy, reset the random number seed
`the.seed` the pass the copied `the` to all subroutines.
